# Algorithms and Data Structures
## Introduction

This repository contains algorithms and their underlying data structures. Every algorithm and data structure has an explanation, test cases and references to further readings. Please note, that the majority of algorithms covered here are implemented in Rust language, but may contain solutions in other languages as well (see **Contributing** section).

**DISCLAIMER**: Provided implementations of algorithms and data structures are meant to be used for learning purposes only. We can not be held responsible for any damage caused by using them in production. There are more efficient and safer ways to implement those algorithms, some of them are most likely built-in into the language of your choice.

In case you find a possible vulnerability or improvement of existing implementations, please open an issue or create a pull request containing the improved implementation. More about this in **Vulnerabilities and errors** section.

## ðŸ«¶ Contributing

To contribute to this repository, your code must be well documented and formatted according to the coding conventions of your selected language. It is mandatory that you thoroughly test your solutions before creating a pull request. All tests should be included in the pull request either directly inside the code or through input/output files that are read by testing frameworks.

Whenever possible, please provide an implementation that can be compiled and executed on most versions.

We are also looking for voluntary translators that are willing to translate explanations and other README files (such as this one).

## ðŸ”´ Vulnerabilities and improvements

All vulnerabilities should be reported using the issue system. If you are willing to solve it yourself, you are welcome to do so. All issues should include a detailed description of the problem and a test case (if applicable). 

## ðŸ’µ Funding and support

We are currently not looking for monetary support. Please consider donating that money to a charity of your choice. You can spread the word about this project and help us improve.
